Gilded Rose Kata
===============================

This kata has been taken from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), which explains:
* The function of the legacy code
* The new feature to add

The more general aim of this kata is to refactor the legacy code to improve its quality.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Jasmine

## Notes on approach
* There is a single test in the legacy code which is failing. I will begin by trying to fix the failing text.
